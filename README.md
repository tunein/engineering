# Engineering

This repo holds artifacts that represent the engineering team at TuneIn.  The way we work, the kinds of jobs we have, etc.  These are artifacts that we don't mind sharing with the world, so this repo is public.

If you're looking for our coding challenges for interviewees, you can find them here:
