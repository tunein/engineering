Engineering Priciples
 
 
 We make time for quality	
 	- We empower quality and build it into the process
 	- We review our designs, our code, and our processes
 	- We establish and follow our own best practices
 	- We optimize for readability
 	- We leave code better than when we found it
 	- We prioritize and measure testing
 	- We 'own' issues and actively seek to destroy the root cause
 	- We believe choosing quality today makes us happy and productive tomorrow
 
 We are agile and pragmatic
 	- We build value
 	- We seek to demo early and often
 	- We decide quickly; we believe perfect is enemy of good
 	- We learn and iterate - we aim to only make new mistakes
 	- We don’t reinvent the wheel
 
 We keep it simple	
 	- We simplify both in terms of code and product
 	- We ask questions, revisit past assumptions, and reduce complexity
 	- We automate repeatable tasks
 	- We actively remove things (code, features, products) that we don't use
 
 We are data driven	
 	- We make logging and monitoring as important as feature development 
 	- We believe baselining usage/performance allows us to iterate with confidence
 	- We use metrics as our guide
 	- We prototype and A/B test to make decisions iteratively
 
 We love getting better
 	- We embrace progress and are not afraid to challenge our own status quo
 	- We make time for education - we teach and learn everyday
 	- We engineer our hiring and performance management practices as thoughtfully as our code 
 	- We are driven by curiosity and geek out over everything
