##Engineering Principles

###We make time for quality
* We empower quality and build it into the process
* We review our designs, our code, and our processes
* We establish and follow our own best practices
* We optimize for readability
* We leave code better than when we found it
* We prioritize and measure testing
* We 'own' issues and actively seek to destroy the root cause
* We believe choosing quality today makes us happy and productive tomorrow

###We are agile and pragmatic
* We build value
* We seek to demo early and often
* We decide quickly; we believe perfect is enemy of good
* We learn and iterate - we aim to only make new mistakes
* We donâ€™t reinvent the wheel

###We keep it simple
* We simplify both in terms of code and product
* We ask questions, revisit past assumptions, and reduce complexity
* We automate repeatable tasks
* We actively remove things (code, features, products) that we don't use

###We are data driven
* We make logging and monitoring as important as feature development
* We believe baselining usage/performance allows us to iterate with confidence
* We use metrics as our guide
* We prototype and A/B test to make decisions iteratively

###We love getting better
* We embrace progress and are not afraid to challenge our own status quo
* We make time for education - we teach and learn everyday
* We engineer our hiring and performance management practices as thoughtfully as our code
* We are driven by curiosity and geek out over everything
